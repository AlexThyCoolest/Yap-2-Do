# Yap-2-Do
A simple voice-powered to-do list app designed to help students stay organized.

## What is Yap-2-Do?

Yap-2-Do is a lightweight mobile app that lets you speak your thoughts and turn them into tasks.

It’s built for students who want to stay on top of their work, stay focused, and use technology that works with their lifestyle.

## How It Works

- Tap a button and speak a task or idea out loud
- The app listens and writes it down for you
- Your voice turns into a to-do item
- Check off tasks when you're done

It’s that simple.

No accounts. No distractions. Just talk, and go.

## How This Connects to Ethical AI in Education

- **Accessibility**: Not everyone learns or works the same way. Voice-first tools help students who may struggle with writing or organizing thoughts under pressure.
- **Privacy**: The app doesn’t collect or store personal data. Your voice is only used to help you create your to-do list, and nothing more.
